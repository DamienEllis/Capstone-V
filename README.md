## TASK SPECIFICATIONS

Remember Cool Tech from your PHP Capstones? Well, they’ve grown orders of magnitude bigger since your last job for them. They now span multiple continents, languages and websites. They make use of multiple different WordPress sites as well as some custom ones. 

Managing all of them and their login details are becoming a very big hassle. One of the Cool Tech execs recommended you to solve their problem because of your great past work.

Build an internal web app for credential management. Credentials are login details (username & password) and can be for a variety of places — WP sites, servers, financial accounts, etc. 

Because of the value of the credentials to be stored in the app, it is of utmost importance that the app is authenticated airtight.

Your web app should have user login and registration, different user roles, and different resource access for each user. Cool Tech has the following five organisational units (OU):

● News management

● Software reviews

● Hardware reviews

● Opinion publishing

● New technology reviews

Each of these OUs has over 10 different divisions within them. Divisions take care of subtasks like finances, IT, writing, development, and so on. 

Each division has its own credential repository which contains a list of login details for various places. All employees of the division should have access to it.

Most employees are only part of one OU and one division with it, but there are some that are part of more than one OU and division. Furthermore, there should be different user roles for the employees.

● Normal users can read the credential repository, and add new credentials in.

● Management users can do the above plus update credentials.

● Admin users can do the above plus they can assign and unassign users from divisions and OUs. They can also change the user role of any user.
